## What is a 401(k)?

A 401(k) account is a retirement savings plan sponsored by an employer (you can't set one up as an individual). The great thing about this is the money you put into this account reduces the overall income that you can be taxed on, more on this later.

Once you have money in an account, you can control how your money will be invested. Don't go running off thinking you have to watch the stock market 24/7 now, stocks are not the only way you can invest. Stocks are hard to predict and are very risky. This is where the value of index funds shines.

## Stocks

Stocks are individual units of ownership for a public company. For example, let's say we have Acme Corp which is valued at $100 and the company has released 100 stock units. The value of the company is evenly divided by the total number of stock units which makes each stock unit worth $1.

If the value of Acme Corp goes up to $200, each stock unit is now worth $2. This type of behavior is what you want if you're trading individual stocks however it is a very hard behavior to predict.

Another thing to note about stocks is that you have to pay for a whole stock unit. If a stock unit is worth $500, you will need to pay the whole $500 to own a single stock unit.

## Index Funds

An index fund is a portfolio of stocks. There a many types of index funds that track different indices. You can think of an index as a slice of the financial market. Indices can slice the market by features such as industry and location.

## What are Tax Rates?

## Example Persona

We'll be using a example Persona to learn how a 401k affects their income.

- Lives in California
- Has a single source of income (W2 employment)
- Is filing their taxes as single
- Makes \$100,000 per year
- [401k contribution limit is \$19,000 (as of 2019)](https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/401k-contribution-limit-increases-to-19000-for-2019-ira-limit-increases-to-6000)

## The Baseline

Let's consider the case where the Persona doesn't use their 401k. Below is how much in taxes our Persona owes:

| Tax Type           | Effective Tax Rate | Taxes Owed |
| :----------------- | -----------------: | ---------: |
| Federal Income Tax |             15.41% |   \$15,410 |
| FICA               |              7.65% |    \$7,650 |
| State Income Tax   |              6.14% |    \$6,144 |
|                    |                    |
| Total Income Taxes |             29.20% |   \$29,204 |
| Income After Taxes |                    |   \$70,796 |
| Take-Home Pay      |                    |   \$70,796 |

## Using a 401k

Now let's consider the case where the Persona uses their 401k:

| Tax Type                | Effective Tax Rate | Taxes Owed |
| :---------------------- | -----------------: | ---------: |
| **Federal Income Tax**  |             11.23% |   \$11,230 |
| FICA                    |              7.65% |    \$7,650 |
| **State Income Tax**    |              4.42% |    \$4,424 |
|                         |                    |
| **Total Income Taxes**  |             23.30% |   \$23,303 |
| Income After Taxes      |                    |   \$76,697 |
| Retirement Contribution |                    |   \$18,500 |
| Take-Home Pay           |                    |   \$58,197 |
