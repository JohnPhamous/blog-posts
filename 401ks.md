401k's might sound incredibly complicated and not worth your time learning but the truth is far from it. If you like optimizing and having your money work for you, then you should read on.

## What is a 401k?

## What are Tax Rates?

## Example Persona

We'll be using a example Persona to learn how a 401k affects their income.

- Lives in California
- Has a single source of income (W2 employment)
- Is filing their taxes as single
- Makes \$100,000 per year
- [401k contribution limit is \$19,000 (as of 2019)](https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/401k-contribution-limit-increases-to-19000-for-2019-ira-limit-increases-to-6000)

## The Baseline

Let's consider the case where the Persona doesn't use their 401k. Below is how much in taxes our Persona owes:

| Tax Type           | Effective Tax Rate | Taxes Owed |
| :----------------- | -----------------: | ---------: |
| Federal Income Tax |             15.41% |   \$15,410 |
| FICA               |              7.65% |    \$7,650 |
| State Income Tax   |              6.14% |    \$6,144 |
|                    |                    |
| Total Income Taxes |             29.20% |   \$29,204 |
| Income After Taxes |                    |   \$70,796 |
| Take-Home Pay      |                    |   \$70,796 |

## Using a 401k

Now let's consider the case where the Persona uses their 401k:

| Tax Type                | Effective Tax Rate | Taxes Owed |
| :---------------------- | -----------------: | ---------: |
| **Federal Income Tax**  |             11.23% |   \$11,230 |
| FICA                    |              7.65% |    \$7,650 |
| **State Income Tax**    |              4.42% |    \$4,424 |
|                         |                    |
| **Total Income Taxes**  |             23.30% |   \$23,303 |
| Income After Taxes      |                    |   \$76,697 |
| Retirement Contribution |                    |   \$18,500 |
| Take-Home Pay           |                    |   \$58,197 |

## Employer Matching

## Tax Benefits

There are 2 types of 401k accounts: the Traditional 401k and the Roth 401k. These accounts are pretty much the same except on how they handle taxes.

### Traditional 401k

The Traditional 401k reduces your overall taxable income.

### Roth 401k
